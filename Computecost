function J = computeCost(X, y, theta)
%   J = COMPUTECOST(X, y, theta) computes the cost of using theta as the
%   parameter for linear regression to fit the data points in X and y

% Initialize some useful values
m = length(y); % number of training examples

% You need to return the following variables correctly 
J = 0;
h = (X * theta);
diff = (h - y);
squared = ((diff).^2);
q = sum(squared);
J = (1/(2 *m)) * (q);
